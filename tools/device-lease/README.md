# DLP-1 device registry (CHE-4506)

`registry.py` is a standard-library inventory and candidate filter for the
CHE-4285 rev 4 protocol. It performs no ADB, network, Multica or lease operation.
The existing SmartQA lease API is unchanged. Broker integration belongs to CHE-4508.

`DeviceRegistry.load(path)` reads a trusted UTF-8 JSON array:

```json
[
  {
    "device_id": "rig-phone-1",
    "aliases": ["usb-fixture-1", "192.0.2.10:5555"],
    "pool": "rig",
    "model": "Fixture phone",
    "api": 34,
    "abi": "arm64-v8a",
    "restricted": false,
    "identity_confirmed": true
  }
]
```

This example is synthetic, not a live-device inventory. Canonical ids and aliases
come from a trusted identity source or verified inventory. Never infer identity
from a matching model, an IP address or a transport's appearance. Alias changes
require a new registry snapshot. Duplicate canonical ids and aliases shared by
different records reject the entire snapshot; insertion order never picks a winner.
Records are immutable. Malformed metadata raises `ValueError`; unreadable inventory
files raise `OSError`. Callers must leave admission closed on either error.

`resolve(alias)` returns the same `Device` for its canonical id, USB serial and
wireless aliases, or `None` for an unknown alias. Metadata includes `pool`, `model`,
`api`, `abi`, `restricted`, `identity_confirmed` and `restricted_policy`.
Unknown model, API and ABI values stay `None`; they are not guessed.

`eligible(alias, state, route="raw_adb")` requires a registered device, confirmed
identity and a fresh `device` state for that alias. Supply the state from trusted
discovery; inventory never caches readiness. Every other state, including
`unauthorized` and `no permissions`, is refused. New records default to restricted
and unconfirmed. This function does not check observation age: the caller must
expire stale observations before filtering candidates.

Restricted devices are refused for raw ADB. The only recognized restricted policy
is `restricted_policy="che-2129"`, with `route="che-2129"` and confirmed identity.
That result means the device is a candidate for the existing audited CHE-2129
command route; it never enables a shell, sync tunnel or root. Unknown policies
and unknown routes fail closed.

The default registry always contains `500c592` in pool `root`, restricted and
unconfirmed, with unknown model/API/ABI. It stays restricted if an inventory row
renames it or supplies `restricted=false`. There is no identity confirmation or
grant for that device in this change. CHE-2082/G5 still requires the device owner's
identity confirmation and per-device grant before any use. Pool membership grants
no permission, including root permission.

Eligibility is not admission. Consumers must still enforce device grants, Android
squad admission, testcase reviews, qualification, existing claims, Artemis execution
locks, lease ownership and leader-verified cleanup/release. The broker, recovery,
remote gateway and live-device recovery work are separate slices. No code here
starts or restarts an ADB server or changes a live device policy.

Run the hermetic tests from the repository root:

```sh
python3 tests/unit/runtime/test_device_registry.py -v
```

The same tests are discovered by the repository's normal pytest unit suite.
